=========================
The app consists in my own CV. It was created as an Assignment. 

The app is simple, but is ready to scale. It shows a modern approach to developing an Android app using Unidirectional Dataflow Architecture (MvRx) and Jetpack components.

To see how I used to approach similar problems with more traditional MVVM architecture, you can take a look at my other project [Check It, Travel Kit][8]

Libraries Used
--------------
* [MvRx][0] for Unidirectional Dataflow Architecture.
* [Epoxy][1] for building screens in a RecyclerView.
* [Koin][2] for dependency injection.
* [Retrofit][3] for REST api communication.
* [Moshi][4] for JSON deserialization.
* [Mockito-Kotlin][5] for mocking in tests.
* [Kluent][6] for fluent assertions.
* [Robolectric][7] for painless unit testing resources.
